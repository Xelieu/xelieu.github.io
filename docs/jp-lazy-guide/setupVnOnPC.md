# Setup: VN on PC

- [Textractor](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupVnOnPC/#textractor) is a tool used to extract `text` from `Visual Novels`

- [Clipboard Inserter](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupVnOnPC/#clipboard-inserter) is used to copy and paste the text extracted by `Textractor` into a `Texthooker` page where you can use `Yomitan` to scan the words and mine it into `Anki`

---

Requirements:

- [Yomitan On PC](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupYomitanOnPC/) already set-up

[Textractor](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupVnOnPC/#setup-textractor)

- Download [Textractor 5.2.0](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HPhYtqcNK66EvAjQnW3Y7jSUYEkwRAEw?usp=sharing) folder
    
    - Some versions are messed up so I recommend sticking to this
    
    - (Optional) [VN Texthooker on Android](https://rentry.co/android-texthook); [Android Setup](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupLnOnAndroid/) is required
        - If you don't have 2nd monitor or want to full screen

[Clipboard Inserter](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupVnOnPC/#setup-clipboard-inserter)

- Download `Clipboard Inserter` from [Chrome/Edge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lap-clipboard-inserter/)

- `Clipboard Inserter` with `texthooker` page from the [Textractor 5.2.0](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HPhYtqcNK66EvAjQnW3Y7jSUYEkwRAEw?usp=sharing) folder 
    - Alternative [Texthooker Page w/ Websocket](https://github.com/Renji-XD/texthooker-ui) (only for know-how)


 Set the System Locale - JP

- This is required for `Visual Novel` to `run`

??? note "Set: System Locale - JP <small>(click here)</small>"

    1. In your `PC`, press `Win + R` key

    2. Type `intl.cpl` > `enter`

    3. `Administrative` > `Change System Locale...` > `Japanese (Japan)` > Restart your `PC`
        - This doesn't affect your `language` on `PC`

        ![System Locale JP](../img/system-locale-jp.png){height=250 width=500}

## Setup: Textractor

1. Open the `Textractor` folder > `x86` > `Textractor`
    - 99% of the time `x86` is better
    - You can also create a `shortcut` or pin it to your taskbar

    ![Textractor App](../img/textractor-app.png){height=250 width=500}

2. Open `Textractor` app and check `Extensions`, if something is missing from my list, you can drag it from the folder into the extension window

    ![Textractor Extensions](../img/textractor-extensions.png){height=500 width=1000}

3. Open your `Visual Novel` then on your `Textractor` > `Attach to game` > `Find your Visual Novel`
    - Sometimes it is named engine, not actual VN name e.g. SiglusEngine
    - It should look like this after attaching

        ![Textracting](../img/textracting.png){height=500 width=1000}

4. On your `Visual Novel`, play it so it can generate the text from the game, after 1-2 dialogues, check back on your `Texthooker` and find a `suitable hooked text` from the drop-down menu
    - Check [Extra Info and Tips](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupVnOnPC/#extra-info-and-tips) if you have trouble finding the proper hook or the text is messy

5. If it's working properly it should look like this:

=== "Textractor and Regex Filter"
    ![Textractor Working](../img/textractor-working.png){height=300 width=600}
=== "Visual Novel Sample"
    ![Visual Novel Sample](../img/visual-novel-sample.png){height=500 width=1000}

It is now texthooking, proceed to [Clipboard Inserter](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupVnOnPC/#clipboard-inserter) to be able to use the text from `Textractor` and use `Yomitan` on it

## Setup: Clipboard Inserter

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` or `about:addons`(firefox) and go to `Clipboard Inserter` extension settings

2. Make sure for:
    - Chrome/Edge: `Allow access to file URLs` is enabled
    - Firefox: `Access your data for all websites` is enabled

    === "Chrome/Edge"
        ![Chrome/Edge URL Access](../img/chromium-url-access.png){height=150 width=300}
    === "Firefox"
        ![Firefox Yomitan Access to all websites](../img/firefox-url-access.png){height=300 width=600}

3. Go to `Textractor 5.2.0` folder and open `texthooker` page

    ![Texthooker PC Page](../img/texthooker-pc-page.png){height=150 width=300}

4. Turn on `Clipboard Inserter` Extension by clicking on it at the `Texthooker Page` located at the top right

    ![Clipboard Inserter](../img/clipboard-inserter.png){height=50 width=100}

5. If working as intended it should paste anything you copy or from textractor:
    - You can now use Yomitan on it

    ![Texthooker Working](../img/texthooker-paste.png){height=300 width=600}


Now that the Clipboard Inserter is working, let's proceed on knowing how to play Visual Novel on Android

## Extra Info and Tips

#### Info 1: Finding the proper `texthook`

??? info "Finding the proper texthook <small>(click here)</small>"

    - Some VNs is hard to hook, messed and/or missing text, on which case **you need to manually find a hook**([video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eecEOacF6mw)) or **search the internet for one** (e.g. Riddle Joker hookcode) then `add hook` > `save hook`

    - Some **VNs problem is the version itself**, you'll be safe using `JP` only version rather than steam/multi-language versions

#### Info 2: Using Regex to remove unnecessary text

??? info "Using Regex to remove unnecessary text <small>(click here)</small>"

    - When all text is present **but there is unnecessary unwanted text**, you need to use [regex filter](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor/wiki/FAQ#textractor-is-extracting-text-mostly-correctly-but-theres-some-extra-characters-as-markupgarbage-eg-a-n-in-place-of-every-line-break-is-there-a-way-to-clean-the-text) which is usually on the 2nd tab of Textractor

    - For regex you need some techy knowledge or search around for a specific VN

#### Tip 1: Getting Visual Novels

??? tip "Getting Visual Novels <small>(click here)</small>"

    To get VNs, search around the web, go to `nyaa` or discord servers that have them or `BUY` them

    - If you pm me, I can give you more details
