# About

I made the lazy guide because:

- Back then I just wanted a straightforward all-in-one source for all the latest tech towards setting up JP tools, everything was scattered and was full of few pages of explanation that I didn't want to read, so I took the matters into my own hands and I've been maintaining the Lazy Guide for a few years now

- My goal is to update whenever there are newer tools around and I'll write it at the clearest/most concise possible
